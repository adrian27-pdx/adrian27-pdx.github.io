              <img src="../pictures/OS.png" alt="Picture of the letter's OS" />
              <p>
                For this project I worked on modernizing an old operating system
                that is call xv6. I made this operating system more modern by
                adding functionality like priority for which programs should run
                on the CPU and adding a time out so that the program that is
                currently running canâ€™t just hog the CPU until it is done
                running and is forced to share it. This project was made using
                mainly C to implement this functionality. However, I also used
                some Assembly to complete some of the work as well.

              <p>
                This project is a small video game that I made that lets you
                play as a few different types of characters including a Knight,
                Mage, or Ogre. This project was written in C++ and was made
                using a lot of Object-Oriented Programming to keep the amount of
                redundant code from being written so that the same code does not
                appear repeatedly. Having the code structured this way allows
                for better efficiency and for the files to be smaller as there
                is not as much of the same code over and over again. This game
                also has events that can be trigged at random to add excitement
                to the game.

              <p>
                For this I decided to write my own implementation of a hash
                table, I made this project using C++. The hash table was
                interesting to me as it provides both instant access to data but
                can also allow for multiple items in a single index of the hash
                table since I used chaining for when there is a collision on the
                the hash table. I build this hash table with the intent to store
                data about movies and T.V. shows and if there was two or more
                with the same hash key to store them in the same index of the
                hash table but add them to a linked list do avoid losing any
                data.
