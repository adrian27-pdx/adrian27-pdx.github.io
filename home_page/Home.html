          Portland State University, I am studying Computer Science. This is my
          personal website to show case all the experience I have gained in my
          time at Portland State University and from previous jobs and
          interships. Here you can find an About Me page that will give you more
          information about myself, as well as a few previous projects that I
          have worked on, and lastly you will find a contact me form if you
