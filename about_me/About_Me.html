              Hello, my name is Adrian Perez Gonzalez to tell you a little about
              myself I have a dog on the left you can see a picture of my dog,
              her name is "Luna" or as I like to call her "Tiny Dog". I am
              currently a Senior at Portland State University and am studying
              Computer Science. I have always been interested in how computers
              work for as long as I can remember which is why I decided to study
              Computer Science. The main topic that interests me in Computer
              Science is Cyber Security; this is the most interesting part of
              Computer Science to me because it is always changing as new
              exploits get identified and patched. I am still relatively new to
              the industry of Cyber Security but have gotten one internship were
              I have learned a lot of the basic of Cyber Security. I am
              currently interring at Lines for Life as an Information Security
              Officer Intern. Where I have learned a lot about how to do proper
              change management, performing vender risk assessments, and about
              NIST security practices. I also have experience working as IT
              helpdesk at Portland State University helping end users diagnose
              and solve their technology issues.
