              Since I am about to start my Senior year at Portland State
              University I have not had a lot of opportunities for professional
              experience in Cyber Security. This is because many internships are
              looking for Juniors and Seniors as interns, however despite this I
              have managed to get experience in the field of technology. I have
              worked as a mentor for a program called Invention Bootcamp, as a
              mentor I would help high school students learn how to code. I did
              this by showing them the basics of coding structure and as well as
              the basics of debugging code. I have also worked at Portland State
              University as an End User Support Assistant which means I would
              diagnose userâ€™s machines and software to see what was causing the
              problem that they were experiencing and fix it. I also have
              experience coding from the various Computer Science classes that I
              have taken at Portland State University. I have experience coding
              in C++, C, Python, Python with Turtle, Java, JavaScript, HTML, and
              jQuery.
