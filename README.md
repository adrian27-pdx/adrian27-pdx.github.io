# adrian27-pdx.github.io

This is my personal website that I built to showcase who I am as a person and what I have done in my
Professional and School work to show the experience that I have gained. I built this website using
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and deployed it using Git Pages. I built this website using multiple pages
instead of just having all the information on one page, I did this because to me it worked better for
organizing the information.

You can run this code by downloading the repository and using the Go Live extention to create a local host for you to see the website. Or you can make a copy of the repository and deploy it using GitHub Pages and then you would have your own version of my website as long as the repository that you make is puplic.

This website is deployed using GitHub Pages following the link below will direct you to the site:
